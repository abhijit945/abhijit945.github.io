## Hello!, I'm Abhijit

I love programming in languages like JavaScript and sometimes in Java. Currently working to build some knowledge in Machine learning and React.
For more about me, please check out my [bio]({{ site.baseurl }}about/) and [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}resume/).

For extra fun, take a look at some of the [projects](https://github.com/abhijit945?tab=repositories) I've worked on. These include the projects that I have worked since college.

Feel free to get in touch by [email](mailto:abhijit945@gmail.com) or on Github ofcourse.

Thanks for checking-in!
