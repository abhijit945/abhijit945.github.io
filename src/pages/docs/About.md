I did my study in Computer Science from [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). I like to research new framework and apply/improve design into my [current](https://abhijit945.github.io/#/projects) projects.

I started developing software for [Cognizant Technologies Solutions](https://www.cognizant.com/) in Bangalore, India;
I did my Masters from UTD and interned at [TradeStation](https://www.tradestation.com/) before moving on to working for [Cerner Corporation](https://www.cerner.com/).

I like to do weekend projects involving React, visualizing using D3, exploring cool JavaScript libraries.
When I am not coding, you can usually find me playing video games such as CS:GO or reading any cool fiction novel.
